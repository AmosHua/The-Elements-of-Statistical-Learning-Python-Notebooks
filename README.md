# "The Elements of Statistical Learning" Notebooks
Reproducing examples from the "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman with Python and its popular libraries: 
**numpy**, **math**, **scipy**, **sklearn**, **pandas**, **tensorflow**, **statsmodels**, **sympy**. Almost all plotting is done with **matplotlib**, sometimes **seaborn** is used.
