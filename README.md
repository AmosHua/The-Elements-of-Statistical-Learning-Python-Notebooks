# "The Elements of Statistical Learning" Notebooks
Reproducing examples from the "The Elements of Statistical Learning" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman with Python and its popular libraries: 
**numpy**, **math**, **scipy**, **sklearn**, **pandas**, **tensorflow**, **statsmodels**, **sympy**. Almost all plotting is done using **matplotlib**, sometimes using **seaborn**. 

## Examples
The documented Jupyter Notebooks are in the [examples](https://github.com/empathy87/The-Elements-of-Statistical-Learning-Python-Notebooks/tree/master/examples) folder:
### [examples/Mixture.ipynb](https://github.com/empathy87/The-Elements-of-Statistical-Learning-Python-Notebooks/blob/master/examples/Mixture.ipynb)

Classifying the points from a gaussian mixture using linear regression, nearest-neighbor, logistic regression with natural cubic splines basis expansion, neural networks, support vector machines and prototypes methods.
